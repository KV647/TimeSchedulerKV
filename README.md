# TimeSchedulerKV
The scheduler is a grid of timeslots with text boxes in each. All timeslots change color depending on the current time, if the slot represnts the current time it will turn red, if the hour has past it will turn gray, if the hour is to come it will remain green. To use each, type anything you want into the textboxes, and click the blue save button to save your text to the local storage. On refresh or closing the page, your text will remain. The current date is displayed at the top.
